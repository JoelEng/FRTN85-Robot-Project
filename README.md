# FRTN85 Drawing Portraits with a robot
(This is the only part of this project which is written by ChatGPT)

# What Is This Project Even?
Oh, hello there, curious human! So, you want to draw a portrait with a robot using Python, huh? Well, you've stumbled upon the right place! This project is all about creating masterpieces that Picasso would envy, but with a touch of automation.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Before you start drawing like the next Da Vinci, make sure you've got these essentials:

* A computer (duh!)
* Python (3.6+ recommended)
* A robot with an artistic flair (or at least one that can hold a pen)

# Troubleshooting
## My Robot Doesn't Understand Art!
If your robot's artistic skills are subpar, it might be a software issue (or maybe your robot just has bad taste). Here are some common problems and their "solutions":

Robot refuses to move: Check if your robot is plugged in and powered on. Sometimes robots need motivation, so give it a pep talk.

Strange lines and squiggles: Your robot might be channeling Jackson Pollock. Double-check the image quality in the images folder. It should be clear and artsy.

Robot rebellion: If your robot starts drawing outside the canvas, blame it on its rebellious AI. Adjust the image size or tweak the code.



# Finally
Enjoy your journey into the world of robotic artistry. May your robot's strokes be as graceful as a swan on roller skates!
